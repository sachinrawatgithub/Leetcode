/*
A SUBARRAY is a contiguous array (i.e., occupy consecutive positions) and maintains the order. 
For example, the subarrays of array {1, 2, 3} are 2^n (n=no. of ele)  {1}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {2}, {2, 3}, and {3}.

A SUBSEQUENCE is a sequence of elements without changing the order  
For example, {nums, B, D} is a subsequence of sequence {nums, B, C, D, E} obtained after removing {C} and {E}.
Generating all subsequences is equivalent to generating a power set (2^n), where n is the size of the given set.

A SUBSET is any possible combination of the original set. The term subset is often used for subsequence, but that’s not right. 
A subsequence always maintains the relative order of the array elements but there is no such restriction on a subset. 
For example, {3, 1} is a valid subset of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, but it is neither a subsequence nor a subarray.

It is worth noting that all subarrays are subsequences and all subsequences are a subset, but the reverse is not valid. 
For instance, a subarray {1, 2} of array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is also a subsequence and a subset.
