Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

class Solution {
public:
// Concept is that (there is always a Majority Element present in the question) hence if I set counter for a element then it should be positive 
// for the traversal of the array  

    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
       int counter=0,ans=nums[0];
       
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++)
        {
            if(ans == nums[i] )
                counter++;
            else
                counter--;
            
            if(counter==0)
            {
              ans=nums[i+1];
            }
            
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
